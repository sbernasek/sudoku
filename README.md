# sudoku

I spent the first half of a very long flight failing to make any notable progress on a sudoku puzzle. I spent the second half writing this library so I could feel better about myself. It solves sudoku puzzles using a blend of heuristic decisions and, when all else fails, brute force. This implementation should be readily extendable to puzzles of arbitrary dimensionality, but my passport expired so I don't anticipate needing to bide my time with 6-D puzzles any time soon.
